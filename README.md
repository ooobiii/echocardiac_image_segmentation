# echocardiac_image_segmentation
In this project, we will train a U-net model to segment echocardiographic images consisting of both ES and ED. In addition, timing images of cardiac images will be segmented, and the volume and area of the images will be graphed. Finally, the worst-performing masks will be plotted with their respective frames.
